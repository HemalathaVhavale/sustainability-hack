#There is growing need to be carbon efficient while building and executing our applications.
Thus we should have the capacity to measure the carbon footprint of our applications and thereby reduce it. 

As sustainability should be the core values in software development, we thought of developing this application to measure the carbon footprint in software applications and thus would be able to stamp whether the application can be considered as green software or not.
#The Front End is developed in Angular and present in greenWhiz-ui folder
#The Back End is developed in Spring Boot Microservice and code is present in finalcarbonfootprint folder
#To run the Front End, load it in Visual Studio and run the following commands
npm install 
npm start
#To run the Back End, load in Eclipse and run using Gradle tasks --> Bootrun
#Launch the application using http://localhost:4200
#Click on Calculator
#Provide the details of the application such as the URL, query parameter and click Submit
#The code will calculate the carbon footprint of the application and provide if it is Green or not
#Enhancements to this prototype will be the application will provide the exact carbon footprint value and how to improve the application
